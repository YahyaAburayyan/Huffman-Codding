# 📦 Huffman Coding Project – File Compression & Decompression

## 📘 Overview

This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm. The core idea is to assign **shorter codes to more frequent bytes** and **longer codes to less frequent ones**, reducing overall file size without losing any data.

Your implementation includes:
- Frequency analysis of input data
- Construction of a Huffman Tree using a custom **priority queue**
- Generation of **prefix-free binary codes**
- File compression and decompression using your custom binary encoding
- A verification step to ensure **the uncompressed output matches the original**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compress any file using the **Huffman coding algorithm**
- Store the compressed result in a binary file
- Uncompress the binary file to retrieve the original file
- Display Huffman encoding table and header information

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Reads any file type (text, binary, image, etc.)  
✅ Constructs a binary Huffman Tree  
✅ Implements a Priority Queue (Min-Heap) for tree building  
✅ Encodes and writes compressed data to a `.huff` file  
✅ Decodes the `.huff` file to restore the original  
✅ Verifies that the original and decompressed file are identical  
✅ Displays Huffman Code Table and Binary Header

## 🧠 How Huffman Coding Works

1. **Frequency Count**: Count how many times each byte occurs.
2. **Tree Construction**: Build a **binary tree** from the lowest frequency characters upward using a priority queue.
3. **Code Assignment**: Generate **unique prefix codes** from the tree (e.g., `A → 10`, `B → 011`).
4. **Encoding**: Convert original bytes into a compressed bitstream.
5. **Decoding**: Use the tree to decode the compressed file back to its original form.

# 🧾 Huffman Compression Header Format – Explanation

This document describes the **header structure** used in the `.huf` compressed file generated by the `HuffmanCompress` class. The header is critical for the **correct decompression** of the file, as it stores all the metadata needed to reconstruct the original Huffman Tree and file type.

---

## 📂 Header Structure Overview

The header is written to the beginning of the `.huf` file and includes the following parts:

1. **File Extension Length** (1 byte)  
2. **File Extension** (N bytes)  
3. **Huffman Tree Length** (4 bytes, big-endian)  
4. **Huffman Tree Binary Representation** (variable-length bitstream)  
5. **Padding (if needed)**  
6. **Final Byte for Valid Bits in Last Byte of Compressed Data** (1 byte)

## 📘 Detailed Breakdown

### 1️⃣ File Extension Length (1 Byte)

- Represents how many bytes the file extension takes.
- Stored as a single byte.
- Example: `"pdf"` → `length = 3` → binary: `00000011`

---

### 2️⃣ File Extension (N Bytes)

- The actual file extension (e.g., `txt`, `pdf`, `jpg`) stored as raw ASCII bytes.
- Needed to restore the file with its original extension after decompression.
- Example for `"txt"`:
